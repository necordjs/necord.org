# Contribution Guide {#contribution-guide}

If you wish to contribute to the necord codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
reduces friction contributing to this project.

## Setup {#setup}

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 18+**, and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository. Make sure you're up-to-date with the **master** branch!
2. Install the dependencies using `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run `yarn lint` to run ESLint and ensure changes respect our styleguide
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/necordjs/necord/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/SocketSomeone/necord/blob/main/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))

A high level overview of tools used:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for code-style
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting

## Contributing to Documentation {#contributing-to-documentation}

If you want to contribute to the documentation, you can do so by editing the files in the [docs](https://github.com/necordjs/necord.org) repository.
The documentation is written in Markdown, so you can use any Markdown editor to make changes. Use `yarn dev` to start a local server and preview your changes.

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that:

- Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for formatting
- Use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for embedding React components
- Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) for code blocks
- Use anchor links for internal links (e.g. `#contributing-to-documentation`)
