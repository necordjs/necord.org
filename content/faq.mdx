## Shared-Hosting {#shared-hosting}

How I can have 2 or more bots in the same application/process?

> You can't, Necord doesn't support multiple bots because Rate limits are determined based on the IP address of the sender.
>	- If your bot shares its IP with other bots it will share their rate limits.
>	- This is a common caveat with [shared hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service) providers and free plans!
